# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that you’ve already combed through, you’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. You’ll then submit a written report based on your analysis and the visualizations you create.

### Purpose
Continue working with workbook to create two new analyses:outcomes based on goals and outcomes based on launch date.
<br>
<br>
- **Deliverable 1:** Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart<br>
- **Deliverable 2:** Outcomes Based on Goals Chart<br>
- **Deliverable 3:** A written analysis of the results (README.md)<br>

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- **What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?**
  - 2 factors that could affect a campaigns success are **Luanch Date** and **Campaign Length.** A campaign that is cut short before it is able to gain momentum might fail before it is given a proper change to succeed. December appears to be the worst month to launched a new. campaign while the months of May and June seem to be the most favorable.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

   - In this figure we can appreciate the realationship between goal amount and the eventual success or failure of a campaign. Camapigns that set thier fundraising goals at more than $50,000, saw an 88% failure rate, while those that set the goals just below that between $35,000- $44,999 where able to fund thier campaigns 67% of the time. Perhaps taking time to bettter understand your audience/base when setting fundraising goals, we can build more succesfull campaigns; while spending tens of thousands of dollars maybe routine for a more affluent donor, setting a too high of goal could alienate a less wealthy donor and make them feel as if their donation was not of importance. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?<br>
   - The data provided only spans 2014-2016. Having a larger dateset that inlcudes a greater amount of years can really be helpful in learning how donors behave in different financial and political times, allowing us to better understand thier spending/donating habits.Another limitation of the dataset is that it does not provide a measure to account on how each of the campaigns where being launched, promoted and marketed. Without this information we are really guessing at what made a campaign succesfull or not. Being able to compare the effectiveness of different fundraising approaches along side with the information given in the dataset, would provide us a more complete picture of what comprises a successful campaign.
